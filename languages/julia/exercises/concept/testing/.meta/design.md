## Learning objectives

- Know how to write a basic test suite.
- Know how to use `@test` and `@test_throws`.
- Know how to use `@testset`s and why they should be used.

## Out of scope

- The other test macros like `@test_broken` or `@inferred`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `testing`: Defining a function with one or more positional arguments that returns something. Bare minimum to be able to understand the basic structure of Exercism exercises.

## Prequisites

- `functions-introduction`: Calling functions is all that's needed to know to solve this exercise.
- `functions-keyword-arguments`: Not strictly necessary, but the method signature looks nicer if `lang` is a keyword argument. <!-- TODO: Decide later based on track progression-->

Even if those are the only prerequisites, it may not make sense to expose the student to this too early.
